# cs-open-courses
A collection of hand-designed course material for CS curriculums.


## Why?
There are already a good number of excellent learning materials for Computer Science and Software Engineering widely available for free on the Internet. The following is a curated list and is not inclusive:
- [MIT Open Courseware](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm)
- [Stanford Free Course Catalog](https://online.stanford.edu/free-courses)
- [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science)
- ...


This repository exists to serve as a templating system for creating course curricula for various Computer Science and Software Engineering course. Each course covers what is widely considered to be essential material in each course (and yes, it is theory heavy). While this material can be leverage by a studious self-learner to teach themselves the principles of computing software, it is actually intended to serve as a starting point for other educators to create high-quality CS/SE course content.


## What?
This repository will eventually cover the following courses:
- [ ] Introductory Computer Science
- [ ] Introductory Data Structures and Algorithms
- [ ] Systems Programming
- [ ] Operating Systems Theory and Principles
- [ ] Computer Networks and Applications
- [ ] Principles of Web Development
- [ ] Building Modern Web Applications
- [ ] Distributed Computing and Applications
- [ ] Relational Database Theory, Design, and Administration
- [ ] Databases in the Age of Big Data
- [ ] Data Mining and Applications
- [ ] Software Requirements and Elicitation
- [ ] Systems Design and Development
- [ ] Software Testing and Analysis
- [ ] Software Engineering and Project Management
- [ ] Classical Applications in Artificial Intelligence
- [ ] Modern Applications in Artificial Intelligence
- [ ] Programming Language Theory, Design, and Implementation
- [ ] Algorithms Analysis and Design
- [ ] Algorithms for Distributed Computing
- [ ] Foundations in Secure Computing


There are several courses listed above where educational institutions would normally combine them into a single course. Practical courses that require software or techniques that can only be acquired/learned during an internship at an organization such as much of DevOps (i.e. Ansible/AWS/TerraScale, etc...) will not be included in this repository.
